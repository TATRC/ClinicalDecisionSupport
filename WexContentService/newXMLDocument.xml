Hirsutism (from Latin hirsutus = shaggy, hairy) is the excessive hairiness on humans in those parts of the body where terminal hair does not normally occur or is minimal - for example, a beard or chest hair. It refers to a male pattern of body hair (androgenic hair) and it is therefore primarily of cosmetic and psychological concern. Hirsutism is a symptom rather than a disease and may be a sign of a more serious medical condition, especially if it develops well after puberty.

Hirsutism can be caused by either an increased level of androgen, the male hormone, or an oversensitivity of hair follicles to androgens. Male hormones such as testosterone stimulate hair growth, increase size and intensify the growth and pigmentation of hair. Other symptoms associated with a high level of male hormones include acne and deepening of the voice and increased muscle mass.

Growing evidence implicates high circulating levels of insulin in women to the development of hirsutism. This theory is speculated to be consistent with the observation that obese (and thus presumably insulin resistant hyperinsulinemic) women are at high risk of becoming hirsute. Further, treatments that lower insulin levels will lead to a reduction in hirsutism.

It is speculated that insulin, at high enough concentration, stimulates the ovarian theca cells to produce androgens. There may also be an effect of high levels of insulin to activate the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-1) receptor in those same cells. Again, the result is increased androgen production.

The following may be some of the conditions that may increase a woman's normally low level of male hormones:

Hirsutism affects women and sometimes men, since the rising of androgens causes a male pattern of body hair, sometimes excessive, particularly in locations where women normally do not develop terminal hair within their puberty (chest, abdomen, back and face). The medical term for excessive hair growth that affect both men and women is hypertrichosis.

One method of evaluating hirsutism is the Ferriman-Gallwey score which gives a score based on the amount and location of hair growth on a woman.

Blood value that may be evaluated in the workup of hirsutism include:

If no underlying cause can be identified, the condition is considered idiopathic.

Many women with unwanted hair seek methods of hair removal. However, the causes of the hair growth should be evaluated by a physician, who can conduct blood tests, pinpoint the specific origin of the abnormal hair growth, and advise on the treatment.

Spironolactone: Antialdosterone antiandrogenic compound.Cyproterone acetate: A progestin that also has strong antiandrogenic action. In addition to single form, it is also available in some formulations of combined oral contraceptives.Finasteride: 5 alpha reductase inhibitor that inhibits conversion of testosteron to more active 5 alpha hydroxy testosterone.Metformin: Antihyperglycemic drug used for diabetes mellitus. However, it is also effective in treatment of hirsutism associated with insulin resistance (eg. polycystic ovary syndrome)Eflornithine: Blocks putrescin that is necessary for the growth of hair follicles.Flutamide: Androgen receptor antagonist.

Hypertrichosis describes hair growth on the body in an amount considered abnormal; extensive cases of hypertrichosis have informally been called werewolf syndrome.There are two distinct types of hypertrichosis: generalized hypertrichosis, which occurs over the entire body, and localized hypertrichosis, which is restricted to a certain area. Hypertrichosis is either congenital (present at birth) or acquired later in life. The excess growth of hair occurs in areas of the skin with the exception of androgen-dependent hair of the pubic area, face, and axillary regions.

Several circus sideshow performers in the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as Julia Pastrana, suffered from hypertrichosis. They were usually displayed as "freaks" and promoted as having distinct human and animal traits.

There are two methods of classification for hypertrichosis. One divides them into either generalized versus localized hypertrichosis, while the other divides them into congenital versus acquired.

Congenital forms of hypertrichosis are caused by genetic mutations. Congenital hypertrichosis forms are extremely rare, unlike acquired forms. Congenital hypertrichosis is always present at birth.

Congenital hypertrichosis lanuginosa is noticeable at birth with the infant completely covered in thin lanugo hair. In normal circumstances, lanugo hair is shed before birth and replaced by vellus hair; however, in an individual suffering from congenital hypertrichosis lanuginosa, the lanugo hair remains after birth. The palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and mucous membranes are not affected. As the person ages, the lanugo hair may thin leaving only limited areas of hypertrichosis.

Congenital generalized hypertrichosis causes males to exhibit excessive facial and upper body hair, whereas women exhibit less severe asymmetrical hair distribution. The palms, soles, and mucous membranes are not affected.

Congenital terminal hypertrichosis is characterized by the presence of fully pigmented terminal hair that covers the entire body. This condition is usually accompanied by gingival hyperplasia. This form is most responsible for the term "Werewolf Syndrome" because of the thick dark hair that appears. Sufferers of this condition are sometimes performers at circuses because of their unusual appearance.

Congenital circumscribed hypertrichosis is associated with the presence of thick vellus hair on the upper extremities. Circumscribed signifies that this type of hypertrichosis is restricted to certain parts of the body, in this case, the extrasensory surfaces of the upper extremities. Hairy Elbow Syndrome, a type of congenital circumscribed hypertrichosis, shows excessive growth on and around the elbows. This type of hypertrichosis is present at birth, becoming more prominent during aging, only to regress at puberty.

Congenital localized hypertrichosis is a localized increase in hair density and length.

Nevoid hypertrichosis may be present at birth or appear later in life. It features an isolated area of excessive terminal hair and is usually not related to any other diseases.

Acquired hypertrichosis appears after birth. There are multiple causes, including the side effects of drugs, associations with cancer, and possible links with eating disorders. Acquired forms of hypertrichosis can usually be reduced with various treatments.

Acquired hypertrichosis lanuginosa is characterized by rapid growth of lanugo hair, particularly on the face. Hair also appears on the trunk and armpits, while palms and soles are unaffected. The excess hair is commonly referred to as malignant down. This hair is very fine and unpigmented.

Acquired generalized hypertrichosis commonly affects the cheeks, upper lip, and chin. This form also affects the forearms and legs; however, it is less common in these areas. Another deformity associated with acquired generalized hypertrichosis is multiple hairs occupying the same follicle. It may also include abnormal hair growth patterns as what happens to the eyelashes in a condition known as trichiasis. Oral minoxidil treatments for hypertension are known to cause this condition. Topical minoxidil used for alopecia causes hair growth in the areas it is applied to, however this hair disappears shortly after discontinuing the use of topical minoxidil.

Acquired patterned hypertrichosis is an increase in hair growth in a pattern formation. It is similar to acquired generalized hypertrichosis and is a sign of internal malignancy.

Acquired localized hypertrichosis is an increase in hair density and length often secondary to irritation or trauma. This form is restricted to certain areas of the body.

thumbHypertrichosis is often mistakenly classified as hirsutism. Hirsutism is a type of hypertrichosis exclusive to women and children, resulting from an excess of androgen sensitive hair growth. Patients with hirsutism exhibit patterns of adult male hair growth. Chest and back hair are often present on women with hirsutism.

Hirsutism is both congenital and acquired. It is linked to excessive male hormones in women, thus symptoms may include acne, deepening of the voice, irregular menstrual periods, and the formation of a more masculine body shape. An increase in androgen (male hormone) levels are the primary cause of most hirsutism cases. Hirsutism caused by increased levels of androgens can be treated with medications that reduce androgen levels. Some birth control pills and spironolactone reduce androgen levels.

The primary characteristic of all forms of hypertrichosis is excess hair. Hair in hypertrichosis is usually longer than expected and may consist of any hair type (lanugo, vellus, or terminal). Patterned forms of hypertrichosis cause hair growth in patterns. Generalized forms of hypertrichosis result in hair growth over the entire body. Circumscribed and localized forms lead to hair growth restricted to a certain area.



Congenital hypertrichosis lanuginosa may be caused by a mutation on the 8q chromosome; however, it possibly the result of a spontaneous genetic mutation rather than inheritance. This form is a dominant autosomal (not located on the sex chromosomes) cutaneous disorder, that affects the skin.

Congenital generalized hypertrichosis has a dominant pattern of inheritance and has been linked to chromosome x24-q27.1. A female carrying the hypertrichosis gene has a 50% chance of passing it to her offspring. A male carrier will pass this form of hypertrichosis to his daughters, but never the sons.

Congenital generalized hypertrichosis terminalis is thought to be caused by genetic changes on chromosome 17 resulting in the addition or removal of millions of nucleotide. The gene MAP2K6 may be a factor contributing to this condition. This condition may also be due to the change in the chromosome affecting the transcription of genes.

Acquired hypertrichosis lanuginosa is commonly present with cancer. This condition is also linked to metabolic disorders, such as anorexia, hormone imbalances, such as hyperthyroidism, or as a side effect of certain drugs.

Acquired generalized hypertrichosis may be caused by cancer. The resulting hair growth is known as malignant down. The mechanism behind cancer induced hypertrichosis is unknown. Oral and topical minoxidil treatments are also known to cause acquired generalized hypertrichosis.

Minoxidil, a medication for preventing hair loss, is thought to trigger acquired localized hypertrichosis. Medication-induced hair changes are often reversible.

The exact genetic mutation that causes congenital circumscribed, localized, and nevoid hypertrichosis is unknown.

A number of mechanisms can lead to hypertrichosis. One cause involves areas of the skin that are transforming from the small vellus type to the larger terminal type. This change normally occurs during adolescence, when vellus hair follicles in the underarms and groin grow into terminal hair follicles. Hypertrichosis involves this same type of switching, but in areas that do not normally produce terminal hair. The mechanisms for this switch are poorly understood.

Another mechanism involves a change in the hair cycle. There are three stages of the hair cycle: the anagen phase(hair growth), the catagen phase (hair follicle death), and the telogen phase (hair shedding). If the anagen phase increases beyond what is normal; that region of the body will experience excessive hair growth.

Hypertrichosis is diagnosed clinically via the occurrence of hair in excess of what is expected for age, sex, and ethnicity in areas that are not androgen-sensitive. The excess can be in the form of excessive length or density and may consist of any hair type (lanugo, vellus, or terminal).

There is no cure for any congenital forms of hypertrichosis. The treatment for acquired hypertrichosis is based on attempting to address the underlying cause. Acquired forms of hypertrichosis have a variety of sources, and are usually treated by removing the factor causing hypertrichosis, e.g. a medication with undesired side-effects. All hypertrichosis, congenital or acquired, can be reduced through hair removal. Hair removal treatments are categorized into two principal subdivisions: temporary removal and permanent removal. Treatment may have adverse effects by causing scarring, dermatitis, or hypersensitivity.

Temporary hair removal may last from several hours to several weeks, depending on the method used. These procedures are purely cosmetic. Depilation methods remove hair to the level of the skin. These techniques produce results that last several hours to several days. Trimming, shaving, and depilatories are examples of depilation methods. Epilation methods remove the entire hair from the root, the results lasting several days to several weeks. Plucking, electrology, waxing, sugaring, threading are examples of epilation methods.

Permanent hair removal involves several options. A number of methods have been developed that use chemicals, energy of various types, or a combination to target the areas that regulate hair growth. Permanently destroying these areas while sparing surrounding tissue is challenging. Laser hair removal is the most effective method of long-term hair removal. Electrolysis (electrology), and Laser Hair Removal are two examples of permanent hair removal methods.

Medication to reduce production of hair is currently under testing. One medicinal option suppresses testosterone by increasing the sex hormone-binding globulin. Another controls the overproduction of hair through the regulation of a luteinizing hormone.

Congenital forms of hypertrichosis are rare. Only 50 cases of congenital hypertrichosis lanuginosa have been recorded since the Middle Ages, and fewer than 100 cases of congenital generalized hypertrichosis have been documented in scientific publications and by the media. Congenital generalized hypertrichosis is isolated to one family in Mexico. Acquired hypertrichosis and hirsutism are more common. For example, hirsutism occurs in about 10% of women between ages 18 and 45.

thumbThe first recorded case of hypertrichosis was Petrus Gonzales of the Canary Islands. This was documented by Altrovandus in 1648. He noted in Gonzales' family that two daughters, a son, and a grandchild all suffered hypertrichosis. Altrovandus dubbed them the Ambras family, after the Ambras castle near Innsbruck, where portraits of the family were found. For the next 300 years there were approximately 50 cases observed. The scientist Rudolf Virchow described a form of hypertrichosis accompanied by gingival hyperplasia in 1873.

People with hypertrichosis often found jobs as circus performers due to their unique appearance. Fedor Jeftichew ("Jo-Jo the Dog-Faced Man"), Stephan Bibrowski ("Lionel the Lion-Faced Man"), Jesus "Chuy" Aceves ("Wolfman"), and Annie Jones ("the bearded woman"), are or were all notable people with hypertrichosis. Extensive hypertrichosis carries an emotional burden and can cause cosmetic embarrassment; however, some people attempt no treatments because they say it defines who they are.

A notable example of congenital terminal hypertrichosis is Julia Pastrana (1834–1860). At the age of 20, Julia traveled throughout the United States in a freak show as the bearded lady, capturing the attention of many artists. She served as an interesting subject because of the intensity of her condition, which portrayed her as having dark extensive hairs distributed equally throughout the surface of her body, even on the palms of her hands. Originally, she was believed to have congenital hypertrichosis lanuginosa; however, the generalized form of the syndrome coupled with her gingival hyperlasia indicated that her condition was congenital terminal hypertrichosis. This was not confirmed until after her death, when it became clear that her X-linked syndrome resulted in terminal hairs.

One record in history concerning congenital hypertrichosis lanuginosa is the hairy family of Burma, a four-generational pedigree of the disease. In 1826, John Crawford was leading a mission for the Governor-General of India through Burma. He tells of meeting a hairy man, Shwe-Maong. Shwe-Maong lived in the court of King Ava and acted as an entertainer. Shwe-Maong had four children: three normal children, and one child with congenital hypertrichosis, named Maphoon. On a second mission to Ava, Maphoon was described as a thirty year old woman with two sons, one of which had hypertrichosis. The affected son was named Maong-Phoset. He had an affected daughter named Mah-Me. Where as all affected members of the family had dental problems, the unaffected members had perfect teeth.
